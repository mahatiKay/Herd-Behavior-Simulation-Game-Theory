# Herd-Behaviour-GameTheory

Brief Description:
Simulated and studied the behavior of players with a common goal and competing interests, in a multi-agent setting with a dynamically changing payoff structure. Each agent (player) has competing interests, and so there are multiple player types 
with an associated rationale for each player type. Further, the setting follows a dynamically changing payoff structure in a repeated game with the players learning from their previous experiences, and so on. The evolution of their knowledge 
and their decision making strategy was studied using graph based visualizations.

To get a better context, please follow the link [HerdResearch_WriteUp.pdf](https://github.com/mahatiKay/Herd-Behaviour-GameTheory/blob/master/HerdResearch_WriteUp.pdf) for the images of the graph visualizations, and for a much clear explanation.
